I'll take only 1000 entries for test and train to speed up my computations at the beginning.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

train_no_sale_price = data.drop(labels=['No-show'], axis=1)
train_sale_price = data['No-show']

x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(train_no_sale_price, 
                                                    train_sale_price, 
                                                    test_size=1000,
                                                    train_size=1000,
                                                    random_state=4)
													
													
													
													for df in [x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test]:
    print(df.shape)
